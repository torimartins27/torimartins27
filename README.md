## Hi my name is Victoria Martins and I am currently a software engineering student at Triple Ten 

I recently graduated UNCW with a Bachelors in the Arts. While I was in school I studied Digital Arts and Computer Science with a concentration in Web Development and Mobile Devices. I am currently in the Triple Ten online Software Engineering program, as well as in the process of revamping my website and making the virtual tour of the UNCW library more responsive to different kinds of mobile devices. As of right now it is only responsive to larger desktop screens. I used Unity, C# and WebGL to build this application and am looking for someone to collaborate with if anyone is interested in helping me making this build more responsive! üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
